# Installation and quickstart

# Installation on OSX

## Build environment

- `brew install leiningen`

## Editor

- [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/)

One of the things that makes editing Clojure code more pleasurable is Paredit mode, where the editor keeps parenthesis balanced for you. There is
a good explanation of the various operations on the Cursive site here: [Paredit mode](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/paredit.html).

# Running the REPL

## From the command line

- Start the REPL: `lein repl`
- Exit the REPL: `CTRL-d`

## Inside Cursive

# Getting starting

## Creating a basic project

- Leiningen can create starter projects from templates, such as the `app` template which is a simple application:
    - `lein new app my-project-name`
